WHAT IS VISUALIZATION?

Data visualization is another form of visual art that grabs our interest and keeps our eyes on the message. When we see a chart, 
we quickly see trends and outliers. If we can see something, we internalize it quickly. It’s storytelling with a purpose. 
If you’ve ever stared at a massive spreadsheet of data and couldn’t see a trend, you know how much more effective a visualization can be.

Visualizing data and looking for trends and patterns facinated me and intriged by all I started learning visualizing data. I took help from various sources. 
Thus I decided to make this compact and easy to learn introduction to various plots and graphs using python visualization module plotly.
